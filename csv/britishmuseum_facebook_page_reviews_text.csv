5,"An amazing place to visit when you're ir London, but time is never enough to lost yourself in this museum. You just cannot stay there for a short time, you have to take your time to appreciate everything.
I really liked the Egyptian exposition, and I wish I had more time to enjoy this place... maybe in my next visit.
The best of all... the entrance is free.","2017-01-09 12:05:07"

Great food","2017-01-09 06:47:25"
5,"a great experience despite having a less time, because the museum closes at 5:30 pm. There is too much to see and learn as the whole history is here itself and providing a privilege to the people a free entry for everyone.. and you get to see whatever the British have stolen from around the world and protected here.","2017-01-09 00:39:56"

5,"My first trip was almost twenty years ago but it is just as attractive as it has been.  Well maintained environment and constantly new content.  However I only managed to complete one section and needed to rush to airport.  I will be back","2017-01-07 09:37:08"
2,"I've been at the Museum in October and left my camera at the courtyard.  That is OK,  my mistake, but when was back there 1 hour later, I was told by the security lady that my gopro was found by them. Great! But my happiness lasted only a few minutes... they said my camera was delivered to someone else who claimed to be the owner. This fraudulent person left no personal info with the security, just took the lost camera with the lost property personnel and went away. Now it is impossible to track him back. In my opinion the procedures for lost property retrieval were too much vulnerable against these kind of dishonest people, but in a public place like a museum of this greatness, the security can't be so fragile.

I'm having a too long conversation via email with the manager, but I have no final answer about this case at all. 

The Museum content is amazing,  but after all that happen my good memories vanished with my pictures...","2017-01-07 08:33:46"

5,"Packed full of all the things I love about history : artifacts,  stories,  legends.  We spent 4 enthralling hours wandering,  and there's loads more left for future visits. History buff or simply a tourist, there is something for everyone.","2017-01-06 10:48:21"
5,"Great experience .... One point to make is that an early arrival is required, hence the mass of historical artifacts on display and the different sections of eras.","2017-01-06 09:44:07"
5,"Superb, amazing, fantastic.  Wonderful guides, so knowledgable. Also good for children, they have a trail, questions etc. and short/brief  explanations of artifacts.  The building in itself is fabulous, where tradition meets modern architecture. Several restaurants and cafes serving great decaf coffee. Oh, and did I mention that it is free to go in? You can nip in, do a few sections and go back, I find this useful as I get very tired looking at so much history.  Although there is the facility to donate just by dropping a fiver or more into receptacle both at the entrance as well as further receptacles dotted around the building.  Please donate to such a fantastic cause.","2017-01-06 07:54:55"

3,"On the South African Art Special Exhibition. 

 It was something of a curate's egg. I'm not convinced that  the juxtaposition of emergent anthropology with colonial historical  and 'contemporary' art really worked (contemporary being  mostly selected from the 70s to the early 'Noughties.') It all seemed to fizzle out abruptly with the 'end' of Apartheid. The more ancient art was fascinating. However, I am not a fan of the geometric, abstract, brightly-coloured or crudely executed work that we were exhorted to connect with it.

Inevtably, one gets the flourishing of post-colonialist verbiage: for instance, a very interesting piece of rock art from the 1860s, well-aimed by the artist at satirising the White diamond-mining  overlords,  portrayed the women in huge crinolines,  and the men with their hands on their hips - but we were told with apodictic confidence that these were representations of the male whose pose was  'typical of a European  power fa√ßade. '

Well - it's the first time I've heard it called that duckie....","2017-01-05 13:15:34"

4,"I could witness all the objects stolen by British and Europeans to Africa and other part of the world. All of these because they want their people to freely visit and see the creations of good artists out of Europe. It's really sad. While others need visa, and lots of money to come here and visit, the British will just go around and freely visit the history of others. It's just sad. It was a good witness. My children will learn...","2017-01-04 04:55:57"

4,"Visited yesterday, was super busy! Need more time to go around but that's a good thing in my opinion. I liked the Egyptian section and the part with the part with the Wellcomm trust donation of all the tablets that was fascinating. 
Only negative is toilets were disgusting, hand washing facilities were broken as was some of the lights so it was impossible to see inside the cubicles. Some of the toilets were leaking. Were it not for these it would have been a 5 star review.","2017-01-03 13:57:54"

4,"Pros - Free. 
Quite big, and you need at least one full day walking around if you want to see it properly. Eat well as you will need energy. 

Cons - Not enough seats.

5,"Great day out. We visited as my eldest, Olivia 8, had been tasked with learning about the Greek age for her homework assignment. We moved through security and entrance quickly. We then were directed to a kiosk where a lovely lady gave us the perfect trail task sheet for Olivia and one more suited to her younger brother Hector. We made use of the family facilities downstairs to store our bags in decent lockers and eat our packed lunch. The trail beautifully brought Olivia's homework to life and proved a most effective conduit to assist her study. Hector's trail was also very useful and he was besides himself with pride at having his own task. While the museum was busy it was still accessible and the other visitors were very pleasant. All in all it was a great trip and we only really studied the Greek and African sections so another visit will soon be in order","2016-12-28 16:05:07"

No s√≥lo vale la pena por la cantidad de reliquias de todas las √©pocas y lugares del mundo, si no tambi√©n por la cantidad de informaci√≥n que las acompa√±an. Recomiendo alquilar una audiogu√≠a (disponible en espa√±ol) por 6 libras, para enterarte bien de lo que ves.

Adem√°s el museo es enorme y con infinidad de salas tem√°ticas, reconocido por las momias y otras reliquias del antiguo Egipto. Londres tiene fama de ser una ciudad cara, pero s√≥lo por museos gratuitos como este merece mucho la pena.","2016-12-18 14:39:51"

4,"Yesterday I visited the Egypt's Lost Worlds Exhibition.  I had recently seen a documentary on the underwater archaeology taking place that has revealed these two ancient missing cities, but it was a joy to see many pieces which had been discovered displayed in the museum, with their historical positioning and relevance explained.  There were also bits of video showing some of the items you were looking at as they were found under the water covered in silt and barnacles.  It was interesting to see the melding of Greek and Egyptian styles in the statuary and learn the significance of this.  One of the highlights for me was the boat of Osiris that had been found was layed out on the floor as a flat picture, so you could actually get a feel for the size and shape.

I would certainly recommend visiting this exhibit (although it finishes on Sunday (27.11.16) so you need to be quick).  Due to terrible traffic (6.5 hours from Sheffield instead of the usual 4.5) I missed my slot for the exhibition by 10 minutes and feared that I might need to pay again for a new slot, but was delighted to be told that I could just go in on my original ticket.  Good stuff - well done all round, British Museum.

I would like to say to the exhibition designers that I found the exhibition very dark - I don't know if this was to somehow protect the exhibits - as they were mostly stone and metal this seems unlikely, or to provide atmosphere, or to make the exhibits stand out more lit up in the gloom.  I find the darkness, and peering through it at lit up information screens rather tiring which combined with not knowing how much more of the exhibition there was to get through.  By 2/3rds of the way through which was over an hour of peering through darkness and having people bump into me (although I didn't know how far through I was) I was suffering exhibit fatigue.  It would really help if you had a little time out room with a cafe and somewhere to sit and recover some energy about half-way round, as I pretty much skipped most of the last third of the exhibit due to a need for light, sit-down and a cuppa.  I appreciate that this is impractical as you are trying to get the maximum number of people through, particularly on busy days, but it is a shame that the end part of an exhibitions probably gets much less attention than it deserves.

I wonder if there could be more signage at head-height directing people to the exhibition and on the doors to the exhibition entrances - a French couple and I circled the whole great hall without spotting the entrance and had to seek directions.  When we went through the first set of doors there was nothing to show that the dim room ahead of us behind a long bank of closed doors was the way in to the exhibition, and the French couple headed off to the right where there was light and obviously things to see.  There was a security guard who I asked if the exhibition was through the doors, but without him, we would still have struggled to find the exhibition.  Maybe we were just very unobservant, but I didn't see anything that obviously said where the exhibition was in big clear letters at head height.","2016-11-25 07:18:28"
5,"I am a regular visitor to the British Museum - my second home. I either to slowly browse the permenant displays or to visit the 'special' exhibitions.
I am a professional archaeologist - a 'digger' for preferance - and therefore critical of layout, display, degree and presentation of information regarding the artefacts, their provenance  and their history.
I specialise in Egypt and the Ancient Near East.

Yesterday I spent an enthralling afternoon in the 'Sunken Cities exhibition. To find something new, to garner some new information, to learn something more doubles my pleasure.
Yesterday I learned something 'new' ..... the significance of the sycamore tree and its use by the Ancient Egyptians.
So not only is this a great exhibition of superb artefacts, they are well displayed alongside well presented information regarding the techniques of underwater excavation and the discovery of the artefacts.
And I learned something, my pleasure was doubled.

It is an exhibition which I would highly recommend to either the professional or amatuer archaeologist ..... and also to any diver with a historical interest.","2016-11-24 07:33:10"

1,"Thanks for the great work preserving all the artefacts stolen during Britain's imperial adventures across the globe. But the word is out and your business model is losing its social licence. It's just a matter of time: you will have to return these goods.

What future then for the museum? How about you 3D scan and print the #GweagalShield and other stolen artefacts so you can send back the originals and keep identical replicas. Kind of like Madame Tussauds for history.

Of course you will also have the digital master and can create amazing immersive online experiences and invaluable research data. That's the way forward.","2016-11-04 16:15:04"
1,"The British Museum needs to reconsider its stand on the return of the Gweagal Shield and spears to Australia.

Whilst this may be considered an integral part of their collection, it is more importantly an important part, and link, of the Gweagal nation.

The British Museum should understand that though this may have been considered was a spoil of war at the time, the world has moved forward, it is a much smaller place now than it was then, and as a result, we are all far more aware of what is right and wrong.

The British Museum has a unique opportunity in front of it right now.
The museum can show itself to be a leader, or it can show itself to be just a follower.
Which will it be?
Will the museum stand up, do the right thing?

The museum should consider itself part of a bigger world, a world of co-operation, of sympathy, of understanding.

We can but hope.","2016-11-04 16:14:07"

What a wonderful gesture of kindness of humanity it would be to return the Gweagal Shield.","2016-11-04 16:11:49"
1,"The British Museum has taken the false authority upon themselves to refuse the return of important aboriginal artefacts (The Gweagal Sheild and Spears) to their ancestral owners.

To end an ongoing culture of war, violence and environmental destruction; As a nation, we must stop taking without permission, keeping without consent and claiming possession over that which is not ours to own.
This ongoing process of fusing colonial practices to our people and land is not irreversible. To support the return of stolen artefacts is to support the healing of our nation(s).

I encourage the British Museum to reassess the reality of who exactly appointed them in charge of our Earths history and the moral grounds on which they continue to forcibly carry out this role without the permission or consent from the cultures they have stolen from.

Until cultural practices are changed, it's a 0/5 star rating from me British Museum

The British Museum should present a good example of social responsibility and cultural sensitivity, especially given their privileged wealth of resources with which they can view our questionable history and learn.

1,"I was so disappointed that the Museum refused to consider the return of the Gweagal Shield to Rodney Kelly, the Gweagal people and all Australians.  You are in possession of property that was stolen at the point of a gun and receiving stolen goods is actually a criminal offence in Australia as I'm sure it is in England also.  You really need to return these artefacts, particularly the Shield, to the Gweagal people through Rodney as a direct descendant of Cooman who they were stolen from by Lt James Cook and his marines in 1770.
The events of that day were recorded by Joseph Banks and perhaps the Museum believes that these artefacts are the spoils of war.  If so, could you please make that announcement because many Australians believe that Australia was peaceful ""settled"".
The shield where it is currently displayed is virtually invisible amongst the multitude of other artefacts from so many different places and the small tag at the bottom says nothing of its true history so how does it help anyone learn about history?
When the Shield is returned to Australia, it will be displayed where everyone can visit it, particularly school children, and learn the true history of the invasion of Australia and the Frontier Wars that followed.","2016-11-04 07:31:20"

I emailed last night and don't reckon this is good enough

""Many thanks for your email. The British Museum acknowledges that some objects, such as the bark shield, are of high cultural significance for contemporary Indigenous Australians and we are always keen to engage in dialogue to see where we can collaborate. The shield has recently returned from loan to the National Museum of Australia as part of their Encounters exhibition. We met with Rodney Kelly and his group last week to discuss the potential for future loans and collaborations. In the meantime the shield is on public display at the British Museum where it can be seen by 7 million visitors a year.""

And know that they were superior for not allowing this unfortunate looting to continue any further.....

1,"End your deal with BP

BP ‚Äì a company that has caused one of the worst environmental and social disasters of all time ‚Äì is gaining credibility by giving money to an institution devoted to conservation. By accepting money from the oil industry the British Museum is legitimising their practices and the consequences of their dirty operations. It is a truly dangerous and careless move.

Even worse is that the amount of money is close to negligible. The amount of money the British Museum received from BP between 2000 and 2011 was less than 1% of the museum's income. The new deal is set to be even lower [1]. So it's clear that the only one truly benefiting from this deal is BP!

Oil is not the future. Oil is air pollution stuck in our children lungs; it's the Arctic melting at an unprecedented speed and 15 consecutive months of record-breaking temperatures.

The Tate has seen that that the writing's on the wall for the oil industry. It already took the decision to cut ties with a polluting industry which, like the tobacco industry, was using advertising and sponsorship as cover for its damaging product.","2016-10-11 05:39:20"

Too many tourists, too much noise and at any time to be beaten, the risk of someone with the Selfiestick. Furthermore I's criticisms, many exhibits are not in chronological order, it is easy to lose track.
What has, however, I really liked, despite increased security level, security personnel remained very friendly and accommodating and the staff at the museum were very nice and helpful.
I will when I'm next time in London, pay the museum a new visit, in the hope that it is then more enjoyable.

As the indigenous people of these areas (North Iraq and so on) we are facing again distruction of our heritage by the Islamic State. Thank you for atleast keeping a part of it safe! <3

5,"Blown away from the moment we arrived and most of the museum is free. We paid for the extra exhibition ""The Sunken Cities of Egypt"" - we were not disappointed. We will have to come back as there was too much to absorb in one visit. It can get a little crowded at peak times, especially in the Egyptian section so best to get there early - that way you can explore the other floors when the crowds descend.","2016-09-20 13:14:32"
1,"Disappointed that the one exhibit I really wanted to see the Acropolis Caryatis was not on exhibition due to gallery maintenance.

3,"Having been looking forward to bringing my son to the museum I was incredibly disappointed in the treatment we received from some staff.  In the already very controversial BP exhibit I was asked to not take photos of my son. I agreed and apologised, only for the member of staff to then take umbridge against the fact he was in there at all. I was told he was too young and shouldn't be running around in there.  Considering it was a ticketed event that we verified our membership at the door, to members of staff, you would think we would be told then no admittance for young children. My son did not disturb anyone or touch anything, in fact all the other patrons smiled happily to see someone so young enjoying some culture.  That member of staff single handedly ruined our visit and I will be rescinding my membership as clearly you are not a child friendly museum.  We have been to the tate galleries, the science museum, and the Horniman to name but a few and yet your world famous establishment is no longer child friendly. Hugely disappointed.","2016-09-20 08:17:51"

And I was really impressed with a curator in the Islamic World, Mr. Edward Phillips, because he could lead some of us who join his exhibition tour yesterday afternoon to another world. With his style of communication, storyline, materials, and some jokes, we traveled back in time without realizing that we were actually in the BRITISH Museum! I gotta say that he made my day!

Even worse, the amount of money is close to negligible; the sum of money received from BP between 2000-2011 was less than 1% of the museum's income.

Paid a fee to look at the underwater Egyptian artefacts, slightly over priced but saw some amazing pieces. The snack bars inside were over priced but you either pay their prices or go without. Gift shops offered lots of choice and prices were what I expected to pay. Toilets were clean but had to queue lots as there are not many there. Staff all seemed occupied but a big presence around. All in all a great day out","2016-09-11 15:40:33"

We were told myself two children to go in the other line as we had no bags. We then had to wait over 20 minutes for him to get through his line of bag checks. When other families were allowed to go together in the shorter line. Some constancy would have been better. We would rather have stayed together!

4,"As much as I like the British Museum and recommend it to every tourist, my experience yesterday left a sour taste. My family had gone for a tour and as it always happens half a day was not enough to see everything!
While the museum was closing they came out but unfortunately forgot their umbrella, after repeated request they were NOT allowed to go in, nor was the umbrella retrieved from the cloakroom by a staff member.

Which he did even through he doesn't speak English, he then asked if he had any sharp items, and when my brother didn't responded because of the language barrier he impolitely said ""I'm talking to you! Do you have any sharp items?"" I said sorry he doesn't speak English, you don't have to be so rude, he said I am pointing at the picture, he is not paying attention (impolitely again).

If the world wants to see the Parthenon marbles then the world can go to Hellas to see them. Your refusal to return these marbles to their place of origin is a continuation of your barbaric mentality. This confirms that once a barbarian always a barbarian.

5,"Today's visit was my first (unless I ever went with school and can't remember) and specifically to see the Sunken Cities exhibition. The exhibition was totally amazing and educationally  informative, so interesting that we spent more time in there than expected so didn't see anything else.  The museum is very light and spacious,  and very well laid out.  The only criticism I have is that on leaving the exhibition rooms and wanting a drink we saw only the small snack bar with a few very crowded tables in the vast court. There is a very large shop in this area,  which is not the only shop in the museum so I would have thought some of that space could be used for more  refreshment seating. Having said that,  it didn't spoil out enjoyment (just meant we spent less money in the museum and had to wait a while for our cuppa!) and we will be back,  but I don't think even a whole day would be long enough to see everything it had to offer. One other small point - I think it very unfair that there are no concessions on entry to the exhibitionfor seniors unless you go early on Mondays and yet under 16s go in free any time.  Before 12 is bad enough but then only on one day of the week is even worse, why should seniors be discriminated in this way?","2016-06-08 15:20:50"

My grandson, with the cutting wisdom of children, once asked a guide:'Why is this called the British Museum, when the exhibits in it are not British?' We could make a whole debate and study on how the exhibits came to be there...however, let's look at the positives. The location and capacity give people the chance to grow in knowledge and appreciation of beauty and cultures. I have become a student on a Community Arts course at Mary Ward Centre, and am greatly enjoying completing a practice brief from the British Museum on how you might involve a group of people who might not visit normally. If it goes well, this is something I hope to develop for real!
When you go, choose one gallery and pace yourself, or you will get overwhelmed. Enjoy!","2016-04-21 02:11:30"

We brought our own lunch (as I have food allergies) so we sat down in the seating area where everyone else was eating to have our lunch too. Halfway through we were told we had to move as they didn't allow picnics in that area and were given directions to somewhere downstairs. However, there was nothing to say we couldn't eat there and the man was really rude. So we headed downstairs and we were told by another member of staff that we had to go to the family and school room, which we did. Yet again we were met with rude staff telling us to get out and that it was a school room not a family room, despite it saying that over the door - something they didn't know!! 2 of your staff members practically pushed us out saying we had to leave. So we were banished to the tables outside the room. Why have a family room and not let families use it? Does it really matter where we eat our lunch? My son was so upset he just wanted to leave and it has put him off wanting to return. I am really disappointed with the whole experience.","2016-04-11 12:37:15"

5,"The British Museum is a world museum in the sense that it displays collections from different world cultures. As to the claims of artefacts being 'stolen', much of them were actually bought or donated and saved from ending up in some private collection or destroyed. Such museums have, in many cases, saved the world's cultural treasures rather than stole them. Incidentally, the British Museum is open to everyone for free.","2016-03-27 15:19:34"

I finally was there in front of it in September of last year.

The entire museum, what I managed to squeeze in over 2 different days, was stellar. The Japanese exhibit, although small compared to some places, was absolutely engaging.

The Egyptian selection was tremendous! I even had a lovely tea and scone 

I highly and absolutely recommend this for a fine and enlightening day. Hopefully I will be back one day to finish up the 50% I couldn't see!","2016-03-20 22:21:40"

We decided to visit on our way back to Kings Cross, we weren't allowed to take our small case or suit carrier in, we were searched then directed to the cloakroom area! There we discovered that cases could weigh no more than 8 kilos, and there was no space available! The poor lady in front of us actually removed clothes from her case and carried the clothes around the museum!
So from a disgruntled Brit, please sort it out!","2016-02-28 07:41:23"

At first, I was a bit dissapointed to not be able to find anything about ancient Jerusalem (Salomos temple ++), the crusades, ww2, knights, vikings etc but then I realised that it must be the obtained artifacts and their story that is the focus of the exhibitions.

4,"Had a great time in the museum, really enjoyed it. However, when eating lunch from the baguette van out the front me and boyfriend witnessed some disgusting behaviour from the staff there. At 12:49 on friday we bought our baguettes and were sat nicely when one of the staff members approached a partially disabled member of the public who was eating his own lunch and was told to leave the seating area. Luckily, his carer came over to explain she was waiting to get food from them to be told that regardless of that, they couldn't sit there. I went over and offered to sit with them so they didn't have to move else where but then told me they had to leave the seating area regardless. 
This is disgusting behaviour. It would be fair enough if neither had got food from the van but the carer was in the queue waiting, so what was the issue?  I find it disrespectful to force a partially blind person to walk up the steps to find a seat to eat their food at a bench. It is completely unfair. Also, it wasn't like it was busy at the time, around 13 tables were free at the time. 
I know this has nothing to do with the museum and its own staff however just needed to raise this issue due to it being from where i stand completely unneeded and disrespectful.","2016-02-20 14:17:32"

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
This article is about the general concept of art. For the group of creative disciplines, see The arts. For other uses, see Art (disambiguation).

Clockwise from upper left: a self-portrait by Vincent van Gogh; a female ancestor figure by a Chokwe artist; detail from the Birth of Venus by Sandro Botticelli; and an Okinawan Shisa lion.
Art is a diverse range of human activities and the products of those activities, usually involving imaginative or technical skill. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. This article focuses primarily on the visual arts, which includes the creation of images or objects in fields including painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, and other visual media. Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the decorative arts, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential‚Äîin a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example. Music, theatre, film, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of art or the arts.[1] Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts.

Art may be characterized in terms of mimesis (its representation of reality), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During the Romantic period, art came to be seen as ""a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science"".[2] Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed[3][4][5] and has changed over time, general descriptions mention an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming from human agency[6] and creation.[7]

The nature of art, and related concepts such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics.[8]","2015-10-31 15:43:59"

5,"The British Museum is the oldest national public museum in the world, first opening in 1759 to display Sir Hans Sloane's collection of 71,000 objects, which he bequeathed to the nation upon his death in 1753. The museum has provided free admission since the day it opened its doors and has expanded its permanent collection to over 8 million pieces, making it one of the largest and most comprehensive museums in the world. 

The British Museum is also the second most visited museum in the world with almost 6 million visitors annually. It is an attraction that is a must-see for first time visitors to London and a place that many English and foreign visitors return to visit time and time again. 

Because of the size of the British Museum, it is well worth having a game plan in mind before your visit. The museum is simply too large to visit in a single day and if you only have a few hours to spend here, it is important to do a bit of planning ahead of time to maximise your visit. 

Below are some tips for how visit the British Museum 

1.) Know the opening days and hours. 
The British Museum galleries and shops are open from 10.00am to 5.30pm daily with extended hours until 8.30pm each Fridays so you can spend more time in the museum on that day. The Grand Court area where you can buy tickets to the special exhibitions and pick up Museum maps opens at 9.00am each morning. 

2.) Do I need tickets? 
The permanent collections at the British Museum are free to visit. If you feel inclined, there are donation boxes at the museum entrances allowing you to contribute and show support to the museum. Consider dropping a few ¬£s in the box or perhaps spending some money in the museum shops or cafes to help offset the costs of operating the museum. 

While the permanent collections are free, there is fee for tickets to the special and temporary exhibitions. You can buy these tickets online or at the ticket desks in the Grand Court during the time of your visit. Refer to the British Museum website 'Whats On' section for special exhibition ticket prices. 

3.) Benefits to visit early or late in the day?
Interestingly, and perhaps because admission is free, we've never encountered queues entering the British Museum, either at the main entrance on Russell Street or the back entrance on Montague Place. This comes with a great sigh of relief and theoretically allows you to plan your day more flexibly, knowing you won't have to wait to see the museum once you arrive (just think of those dreadful queues outside the Louvre in Paris or the Vatican in Rome). 

However, while entry queues are not an issue at the British Museum, this doesn't mean that you won't encounter large crowds once incise. For example, we have visited and witnessed shoulder-to-shoulder people into the Egyptian galleries. This makes for a much less enjoyable museum experience. As such, it is still worth considering an early or late visit, when the bulk of the crowds can be avoided. 

Some attractions in the museum, like the Rosetta Stone, just seem to always have a crowd lingering. Be patient and you'll be able to eventually get close to these items to see up close. 

4.) Know what you want to see before you arrive! 
The number of galleries, antiquities and artworks at the British Museum can seem daunting at times, especially if you arrive without knowing what is available to see and how to go about your visit. In this regard, one of the most useful things you can do before arriving at the museum is to simply familiarize yourself with the museum layout and determine what galleries and specific items you want to see while you are there. There are several simple ways to do this. 

First, we recommend spending a bit of time on the British Museum official website, reviewing the 'Visiting' Section and 'Floor Plans and Galleries' pages of the website so you can get a feel for the layout of the museum. For those with limited time to visit the museum, you might also want to review the 'Planning Your Visit ‚Äì Object Trails' pages. Here you can find a variety of suggested walking tours, covering different combinations of museum highlights. 

Secondly, it is well worth purchasing a good travel book for London (we like the DK Eyewitness London Guide). When doing this, have a look at the written section for major attractions like the British Museum, which should include at minimum ‚Äì a map and layout of the museum, descriptions for the important galleries and highlight attractions within the museum. A good guide book can go a long way to helping you plan your time at the museum and you can use it along with the free museum Map to help navigate your way around during your visit. 

5.) Use the free foldable British Museum Map: 
In the Grand Court you will find free foldable Map, which are the single best resource for you to use when navigating your way around the museum. The map includes not only the museum layout but lists the regional galleries and room names along with some of the most popular museum highlights. 

While the layout of the museum is quite intuitive, it remains a vast complex of rooms and it can be easy to lose track of where you are at times. Having the handy folded Map can help you stay on track and navigate your way through the museum. 

6.) Wear comfortable walking shoes. 
Museums like the British Museum require you to spend a lot of time on your feet. Wearing comfortable walking shoes can make a big difference in the quality of your visit and your overall experience. 

7.) Coffee, snack and lunch breaks! 
There are several museum cafes and a restaurant within the British Museum. They are a bit pricy, as you would expect when visiting museum eateries. However, it can be a good idea to take a break at some point during your visit and let your feet rest. This can make a difference if you are intending to spend several hours or more at the museum. 

8.) Save the museum shops until the end! 
There are four different shops within the British Museum where you can pick up souvenirs of your visit. However, we suggest holding off your purchases until the end of your visit. The Great Court Shop and the Collection Shop found in the Great Court have a large number of items and you'll likely pass back through the area just before leaving. 

In the end, the British Museum is easily one of the very best museums in the world and it is free to visit. It's one of those places that you really should try to make time for when visiting London. We have been numerous times and always find a reason to go back.","2015-08-12 03:35:02"

AUSCHWITZ ANNIVERSARY OF THE LIVERATION
 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp is a reminder, at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise again, of what happens when the world stays silent about persecution, the president of the World Jewish Congress said.
 
Ronald S. Lauder told Reuters in an interview anti-Semitism had reached levels not seen since World War Two, driven by Islamist extremists using hatred of Jews as a way to attack Israel, and by far-right nationalists in Europe.
 
He said the commemorations on Jan. 27 to mark the day Soviet troops liberated Auschwitz in 1945 would be the last major anniversary when survivors would be able to attend in numbers. The youngest are now in their 70s.
 
""I believe it is a good reminder to people of what happens when we remain silent, and the world was silent when Hitler was starting, the world was silent when Jews were taken away, the world was silent at Kristallnacht and in many ways, although many people knew what was happening in the concentration camps, it was not publicized,"" Lauder said.
 
""After World War Two, into the 50s, 60s and 70s, the type of anti-Semitism we see today, nobody would ever have thought of happening. But as time has gone on and generations have passed, we see the rise of anti-Semitism.""
 
""Hopefully this commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the freeing of Auschwitz, and the ceremonies that will take place, may remind the world what it is happens when anti-Semitism is allowed to run wild, so to speak.""
 
At the Auschwitz camp, in southern Poland, the Nazis killed some 1.5 million people between 1940 and 1945, most of them Jews.
 
Lauder, who has helped fund conservation efforts to preserve artifacts at Auschwitz including inmates' hair and shoes, said the World Jewish Congress would this year bring about 100 survivors and their families to Poland to take part in the commemorations.
 
He said Hungary, where the far-right Jobbik party is now the second biggest political force, was one example of a European country where a political party was fanning anti-Semitism.
 
""The government will talk about 'There is no place for anti-Semitism in the world,' but that is not necessarily speeches being made inside Hungary,"" Lauder said.
 
""There is a total disconnect between what they say for external consumption and internal consumption.""
 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has called anti-Semitism intolerable and says his government is a determined participant in the fight against it. Jobbik's leaders deny being anti-Semitic.

Apart from that I thought it was like the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, but bigger. With regard to archaeology, I thought Gebelein Man was the most interesting. I think it's a shame I didn't get to see Lindow Man, but have been able to see Lindow man on Google.

5,"I loved British Museum & spent much of my time in London viewing exhibits.  Beautiful place!  However I agree somewhat with you, Prometheus Celikten. Serious consideration should be given to the return of the Greek marble artworks.  And I don't agree with those who state that these precious artworks would not be properly cared for in Greek museum.  That attitude is rather misguided & I say that politely.  Furthermore, there has been much theft from other cultures by colonial powers (Great Britain). Many artefacts were stolen from Australian indigenous peoples ..... causing much distress.  Other nations are also guilty of theft from vulnerable nations in past times & more recently eg Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam - invaded & violated under guise of ""protecting their nations against the evils of ??Communism, Fascism & more recently Taliban (morphing into ISIS??""  Strange world we live in .....  

Prometheus Celikten, message from Sanita Bepete was in Russian - not Greek which you also do not understand. I'm guessing you are Turkish or Armenian?  I am Australian of Russian descent so am familiar with Russian language. Anyway ""thank you"" for your concern for stolen Greek marble artworks!","2014-12-19 21:44:34"

5,"Mass Demonstration in Rajbiraj, Saptari by more than 15000 Supporters of Dr. CK Raut against Nepali colonisation, racism and discrimination in Madhesh Saptari, Rajbiraj, 2014 December 4 -- 


The supporters of Dr. CK Raut, a Madheshi rights activist advocating the secession of Madhesh--the southern plain region of Nepal, demonstrated in more than 15000 in Sapatri, Rajbiraj on Thursday, to protest against discrimination,colonisation and racism imposed on Madheshis by the Government of Nepal. A number of other prominent Madheshi activists also addressed the mass-meeting organised by 'Save Dr. CK Raut Struggle Committee'. The speakers Dr. Raut, Kailash Mahto, Chandan Singh, Binod Yadav, Md. Usman Miya, Mahesh Yadav, Devram Madheshi and others highlighted various aspects of Madhesh, from early glorious history to Nepali colonisation.


Madhesh has been a great nation since the ancient time, ruled by a number of glorious kings/princes and emperors, including from Janak to Buddha and from Salhesh to Harisimhadev. Before Gurkha's invasion in the late 18th century, Madhesh was ruled by the Sen kings. It was only in 1816 and 1860that the British handed over parts of Madhesh to theKing of Nepal, instead of paying an annual sum of two-lakhs rupees. Since then Madhesh has been a colony of Nepal, and even until 1958, Madheshis--the people of plains--required a visa to travel to Nepal (the Kathmandu valley).Madhesh has been colonised by the Nepali rulers, by bringing in almost 95% of colonial armies from outside Madhesh, and Madhesh themselves are virtually banned from entering into the army. Madhesh has been colonised by the ruling class Pahadi peole from the north at an extremely alarming rate, by systematically settling Pahadi people in Madhesh confiscating land from indigenous Madheshi people, making them landless,and eventually displacing them. Only between 1951 and 2001, the population of Pahadi people in Madhesh increased from 6% to 33%. Madhesh contributes upto three-quarters (75%) of total revenues of Nepal, yet it barely gets 5-6% of national budget.Due to extreme exploitative colonial policy of the Nepali ruling class in Madhesh, Madheshis are forced to be landless slaves even in the 21st century, on their very own land, and their existence itself has been at stake now. In Madhesh, which is also known as the bread-basket of Nepal, 19% of families are facing acute food shortage, 20.4% children have wasting status, and 50.2% children and 42% women are anemic.Madheshis have struggled for long to liberate themselves from the Nepali colonial rule and racism. In the last 60 years alone there were severalpolitical movements and Madheshis have sacrificedhundreds of lives to secure their rights and freedom,yet they were always brutally suppressed by the Nepali regime, and their rights always denied. Therefore, the speakers argued, there is no alternative to independent Madhesh. Only with the independence, Madhesh can have its own army, police and administrators,and only by self-rule, Madheshis can get their rights.The continued colonial exploitation, racism and ethnic cleansing of Madheshis even in the 21st century is a stigma on the whole human civilisation and to help Madhesh to get rid of them is the responsibility of all nations, world-citizens,journalists, intellectuals and diplomats. Therefore, to draw the attention of the SAARC countries, a memorandum was also submitted to the SAARC Secretariat.Dr. Raut was arrested on September 13th, 2014 by the Morang Police. The government of Nepal had filed a treason charge against him demanding life-imprisonment on October 8th for expressing hisviews on separate Madhesh.

Not really a review but this happened a few years ago and tickled me:

At the British Museum shop.

""Those postcards are 10 for ¬£1 or 60p each, sir""

""I want these 2 please""

""Certainly, that will be ¬£1:20 please""

""Why can't I have them for ¬£1?""

""Because you don't have 10""

""So if waste my time picking up another 8, and then you waste your time scanning them into the till and I then leave them on the counter when I go, I will only have to pay ¬£1""

""What you do with the cards after you have paid for them is entirely up to you, sir""","2014-10-27 13:17:03"

2,"""The Honourable Lord has taken advantage of the most unjustifiable means and has committed the most flagrant pillages. It was, it seems, fatal that a representative of our country loot those objects that the Turks and other barbarians had considered sacred"" -- Sir John Newport, on the Elgin Marbles.

    Dull is the eye that will not weep to see
    Thy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed
    By British hands, which it had best behoved
    To guard those relics ne'er to be restored.
    Curst be the hour when from their isle they roved,
    And once again thy hapless bosom gored,
    And snatch'd thy shrinking gods to northern climes abhorred!  --Lord Byron","2014-08-13 09:08:18"

3,"Booked to see the Viking Exhibition last Thursday afternoon (May 8th).  I didn't receive a booking confirmation, and when I emailed your Customer Services to confirm our allotted time slot, it was confirmed that I'd bought ONE ticket, not two!  Further emails confirmed that I had actually bought two as thought, although no apology.  The excuse given was that a glitch in the programme meant that not everybody making a booking received a confirmation.  
Then we arrived!  Far too many people arriving at the same time - we felt very pressurised into 'moving along', and spent much of the experience apart, when it would have been nice to discuss what we had looked forward to seeing.  The staff were unhelpful, as I explained that we didn't have our booking confirmation; sent us to a ticket collection desk, who sent us back to the exhibition!
I found the general signage quite poor too, we spent ages trying to find a particular staircase to take us to another exhibition, but when we found our way, the access rooms were closed!
And lastly, the toilets!!!  In particular, the ones below the Central Hall.  Phew!!!  You could smell them as you were going down the stairs, add lack of ventilation to the mix and you were in for a fine old time!
I did enjoy my visit, but my experience will certainly make me think twice about booking up again","2014-05-14 06:12:42"

2,"I've visited the Viking Exhibition and  although I learnt much, it wasn't enjoyable.  I find you are allowing too many people in each time slot in recent exhibitions and this makes it a really poor experience.  I have a feeling this has been getting worse, which gives me the impression you are trying to maximise the take in money terms, but at the cost of the viewer's diminishing pleasure. It's really difficult to get to read the notices or see the displays properly, and of course one is aware there is a great mass of people behind you, so you feel guilty about looking for more than a minute or two.  I've been to other museums and gallery exhibitions (eg Leonardo at the National), and the BM is by far the worst in recent years.

5,"The British Museum Viking Exhibition was amazing! The artefacts assembled certainly displayed a broad spectrum of the talents possessed by Northmen. As a confessed fan of all things Norse, I had an absolute ball. The only down side was the crowds of people I had to share the experience with - (most of whom were sadly fractious at having to queue to go in, then queue to see each item as there seemed far too many people in the area/time allotted) Happily, I am glad I made the effort to read the weighty exhibition publication before attending so I didn't need to read every item label obscured by my fellow viewees - the photographs in the book are very good, but nothing beats seeing the intricately detailed items 'in the flesh' or the gravitas of their immensity as in the ship, Roskilde 6 - they were all astounding.
Hero/heroine of the day was the British Museum's young female member of staff manning the door and using every diplomatic fibre she had to appease and re-direct disappointed, crabby or intractable customers - Bravo to that young woman - she was clearly channelling Tyr!","2014-04-09 08:13:59"

The first thing that came to mind was, well seen it all here, no need to go to Greece or Egypt.  Then I thought, why is it called the British Museum?? Aaaah yes, cause it's in Briton I thought!  I have a great idea on how to give this museum a more British feeling to it. Why not take those large blocks of stone called Stonehenge and put up in the so called British Museum??","2014-03-06 09:46:24"
1,"The management of this museum is a bunch of  thieves that make money with no respect to other nations. A disgrace for British people which I happen to love. RETURN the GREEK MARBLES as they were ""given"" to Thomas Bruce, the 7th Earl of Elgin, by the Turks, while Greece was under the Ottoman Occupation, back then. That's the way to show some degree of civilization. Cause till now the only word that describes this museum is... $iffilization in every aspect. Does not respect British society either. Return and apologize if you wanna be civilized.  It's not yours. You should pay rent for those gems. I would give no star If I could do so. The New Museum of Acropolis must be their new home now. Enough is enough. Don't act as if you owned or own them for eternity. Such a disgrace...","2014-03-04 18:58:47"

Debating who possesses current ownership at the expense of profit pales to our debt to honor history.","2014-03-02 18:26:18"

2,"I would like to protest the despicable stand of the British Museum in refusing to return the Parthenon Marbles to their rightful owners. Lord Elgin took advantage of an enslaved and helpless people to make a deal with those who occupied their country for 400 years to ""purchase"" something that didn't belong to the occupying powers. In essence the Greeks were robbed of their heritage. Every time I go to the wonderful New Acropolis Museum my heart aches when I see the empty spots (such as the one for the missing Caryatid) and the copies where the original sculptures should be. A thousand times shame on you!","2014-03-01 07:18:08"

Just wish you would kindly reconsider your position with regards to the Parthenon sculptures as we all feel that something could be done to reunite them in the Acropolis Museum.

1,"Elgin, a thief, a looter plundered the Acropolis and sold entire friezes and metopes to the British Museum. Despite repeated requests to return The "" Elgin Marbles "" they have refused to do so. Their pitiful reason for not returning the stolen is that they are looking after them. The real reason is, if they return the Marbles, the floodgates would open for similar demands. Rosetta Stone comes to mind . Perhaps they should get off their fat bottomsand visit the beautiful Acropolis Museum in Athens and see how wrong their position is in withholding Greece's national treasures.","2014-02-19 03:12:21"

The Rosetta Stone, the frieze from the Parthenon and many more incredible relics can be viewed and studied there.

5,"To appreciate the history behind what the museum has to offer, inform yourself about the human story behind the monuments, articles etc... By knowing who was involved, when, how, where, you feel more involved and will inevitably remember the experience more vividly and passionately, instead of just walking in and looking at things you know very little or nothing about.","2013-01-07 19:37:36"

Magnificent collections and various theme exhibitions of the venue in London have been tremendously making museum visitors surprises in teams of multicultural humanities. Indeed, British Museum is the hottest spot of London, and it will be a wonderful trip when people visit this museum. Lucky enough, I have been there several times and deeply impressed. Visit it again, of course I will.","2011-09-26 21:29:36"
