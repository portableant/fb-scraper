72228529722_10154935173479723,"American artist John Singer Sargent was born #onthisday in 1856. He was known for his portraits, and became one of the most sought after portrait painters of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His style echoed that of earlier artists Frans Hals and Diego Velazquez, using a looser painting technique to produce intensely personal portraits. Here are two black-and-white prints he made, along with some colourful watercolours from his travels in Europe.

It was the Chinese who first printed a value on a piece of paper and persuaded everyone that it was worth what it said it was. The whole modern banking system of paper and credit is built on this one simple act of faith. 

This banknote is from 1375, and is given the title of 'Great Ming circulating treasure note'. The Ming were the first Chinese dynasty to try to totally replace coins with paper money, however inflation quickly eroded its value. The effect of inflation was so devastating that paper money was regarded with suspicion in China for many years and it was not until the 1850s that paper money was issued again.

Made by Hans Schlottheim in German, in about 1585, the central figure of the galleon is the Holy Roman Emperor, surrounded by seven noblemen. When the clockwork mechanisms were wound, the ship moved forward over the table and they bowed in front of the Emperor. Miniature figures of the trumpeters and drummers on the deck moved in time to music that was generated by an internal organ and drum. The front canon also fired, lighting a fuse which in turn fired the canons on each side of the ship.

In 1964 he was imprisoned on Robben Island for sabotage. In this work, the artist's face is partly covered by a map of District Six and one of Robben Island.

The work also relates to the Purple Rain Protests of 1989, when protesters captured the police water cannon being used to spray them with purple dye and turned it on their assailants. Over the following days the slogan 'the purple shall govern' was painted on walls around Cape Town. Although a tension remains, Sibande is saying goodbye to Sophie, her past, and confronting the 'purple' present and future.

Workers could sell their products in exchange for these notes which would then be accepted as a form of currency. The system aimed to reward workers fairly for their work, instead of just profiting from their labour.

It is thought that the long jump had a much-reduced run-up compared to the modern event, and may have been made up of multiple leaps more like the triple jump we know today.

The statue highlights the ancient technique of a three-quarter turn rather than the full rotations we see today. Greek discuses were on average slightly heavier (+0.5kg) than the modern 2kg discs, which together with the shorter turn, could account for the record being significantly shorter than today.

On the pottery you can see athletes stopping to pick up their shields, or people falling over having tripped up over their armour. However, the race also had a serious side. It was the last event at the Games, and this type of athletic training would have had a real-world benefit for soldiers in battle.

This fluidity in working is reflected in his very individual painting style – his work served as an inspiration for realist and impressionist painters over 200 years later. These drawings show that Velázquez was obviously a talented and sensitive draughtsman, and the later print (by Francesco Cecchini) shows a representation of Velázquez himself.

He is now recognised as one of the most important artists of the Romantic movement, which emphasised emotion and a sense of the power of nature.",Photos from British Museum's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/britishmuseum/photos/a.418481824722.188981.72228529722/10154245666319723/?type=3,2016-06-11 05:00:00,4247,37,989,4015,193,39,0,0,0

Alexander was always shown clean-shaven, whereas all previous portraits of Greek statesmen or rulers had beards. This royal fashion lasted for almost 500 years until the Roman emperor Hadrian (r. AD 117–138) brought beards back into vogue.

Alexander was hailed as a liberator when he conquered Egypt in 332 BC. He notably founded Alexandria in 331 BC and introduced Greek traditions such as athletic and musical contests, while also adopting the Egyptian belief in divine kingship to his own advantage.

Paper currency was first used in China as early as AD 1000. It was the Chinese who first printed a value on a piece of paper and persuaded everyone that it was worth what it said it was. The Ming were the first Chinese dynasty to try to totally replace coins with paper money. After seizing power from the Mongol rulers of China in 1368, the rulers of the Ming dynasty tried to reinstate bronze coins. However, there was not enough metal available for this, and paper money, made of mulberry bark, was produced from 1375. 

The first banknotes in Europe were issued in Sweden by the Stockholm Banco in 1661. They were carefully printed on handmade paper and were given official authority by impressions of several seals and no less than eight handwritten signatures. The first plastic notes in Britain entered circulation in Scotland last year when Clydesdale Bank unveiled its new £5 note. The durability and increased security afforded by polymer notes have made them an attractive proposition to issuing authorities throughout the world from Australia and Nigeria to Brazil and Canada.

Cities and empires traded without using coins for over 2,000 years, but when ancient kingdoms like Lydia (in modern Turkey) began issuing pieces of electrum (a mixture of gold and silver) like this one around 600 BC, the idea quickly caught on and spread to city-states in the ancient Greek world.

These coins had a design on one side only – a result of the method of manufacture. The coins were hand struck. A die with a design (in this case a lion's head) for the front of the coin was placed on an anvil. A blank piece of metal was placed on top of the die, and a punch hammered onto the reverse. The device of the lion on these coins has often led to the assumption that they were issued by a royal power, the kings of Lydia, although we cannot say for certain who minted these earliest coins. http://ow.ly/RCU9300zkpq

72228529722_10154176988539723,"The enormous Cuerdale Hoard of Viking silver was discovered in Lancashire #onthisday in 1840. The hoard, which is the largest Viking silver hoard known from western Europe, consists of over 8,500 silver objects, weighing some 40kg in total. Most of the pieces are coins, together with ingots (silver bars) and cut-up brooches, chains, rings and other ornaments (known as hacksilver). Most of the hoard's coins were minted in Viking-controlled England, while the hacksilver is mainly Irish or Irish-Viking in form and decoration. Other pieces originated from further afield – Scotland, the continent, Scandinavia, the Baltic Sea region and the Islamic lands of Central Asia and the Middle East. In this way, the Cuerdale Hoard reflects the Vikings' extensive international connections across much of the known world.

This enormous silver treasure was discovered by workmen repairing the bank of the River Ribble in 1840. Records from the time describe how one workman's spade hit loose coins, spilling them into his wheelbarrow. The hoard was taken to Cuerdale Hall, where it was said to cover a sitting room floor.
A hoard of this size represents extraordinary wealth – probably of many persons rather than one individual. It is likely to have been collected over time as loot, tribute and through trade. The reasons for the Cuerdale Hoard's burial are not known. It may have been hidden for safe-keeping at a time of unrest, or represents a secure method of stock-piling riches over time.
The latest coins in the hoard enable us to date its burial to between about AD 905 and 910. This, together with the Irish origin of most of the hacksilver, has fuelled speculation that the hoard belonged to Vikings who were expelled from Dublin in AD 902.

The idea came to her while staying with her companion, Margaret Bentinck, Duchess of Portland, in Buckinghamshire. She had noticed the similarity of colour between a geranium and a piece of red paper that was on her bedside table. Taking up her scissors she imitated the petals. Upon entering the room, the duchess mistook them for real: 'Her approbation was such a sanction to my undertaking... and gave me courage to go on with confidence'. Delany later wrote that her work was intended as an imitation of a 'hortus siccus' or collection of dried flowers. 

In creating a 'mosaick', she would cut minute pieces of coloured paper and stick them on a black background to represent each part of a specimen. She created nearly 1,000 collages before failing eyesight caused her to stop in 1782. They filled ten albums which came to the British Museum in 1897.

The entry for each day is prefaced by three hieroglyphs that indicate 'good' or 'bad'. The 'bad' hieroglyphs are written in red. If a day is partly good and partly bad, the relevant hieroglyphs can be mixed to represent the assessment of the day. The character of a day often derives from events told in mythological history. An example of a bad day: 'Do not go out on this day. Do not turn your back to do any work at sunset. Whoever is born on this day will die through a serpent'.

It began life as a drinking vessel and would originally have been used at late medieval feasts, underlining the wealth, status and taste of its owner. It is made from finely hammered sheet silver, creating a shimmering reflective surface, and has been edged with gilded decoration and twisted ropework. Surviving English medieval silverware is exceptionally rare. Because of the value of the material, it was almost always melted down so the metal could be reworked.

Early in its history the Cup was given to St Cyriac's Church in Lacock, Wiltshire where it was used as a chalice for over 400 years. During the English Reformation many churches were stripped of their medieval furnishings and church plate. However the Lacock Cup's elegant simplicity, and its capacity to hold wine for the whole congregation, made it appropriate for use in post-Reformation worship. Having survived in near perfect condition, the Cup is a testament to the deep regard and care which the people of St Cyriac's invested in it.

The Normans were Christian descendants of the Vikings ('north men') who had settled in northern France. Around AD 1000, groups of Normans left France for southern Italy. After earlier raids on Sicily, the Norman brothers Count Robert Guiscard and Duke Roger de Hauteville began a full-scale conquest of the island in May 1061, supposedly with only 450 knights. It took them until 1072 to reach Palermo, and only took it after a long siege. Eventually, the conquest of the island would take 30 years. This was partly due to a rebellion against their rule in the south of Italy at the same time, but mostly because warfare was necessarily seasonal – ships had trouble making the crossing to the island during winter. Over time, the Normans realised that in order to found a successful new kingdom, the existing populations of the island – Muslims, Orthodox Greeks and Jews – needed to be integrated in society, not marginalised. Under Roger's son, King Roger II, this multiculturalism became much more visible in the island's art and architecture.

People would dance, gather flowers and celebrate with public games, theatre and merrymaking to mark the arrival of longer days and the start of the farming season. 

In the UK, May Day has long been celebrated with a mix of Anglo-Saxon and Celtic traditions. The Celtic festival of Beltane takes place on 1 May.

A market for perfumes and incense existed in the ancient Near East and Egypt since at least the 3rd millennium BC. In the 1st millennium BC historical sources begin to refer to an Arabian origin for many of these. According to classical writers like Pliny, the most valuable forms of incense were frankincense and myrrh. These were two of the three gifts (along with gold) offered by the Magi or 'three wise men' to the infant Jesus in the Bible. Texts from South Arabia (modern Yemen) refer to many more types of aromatics, which became essentials in the royal courts, temples, houses and tombs. Their high value, light weight and long shelf life made them ideal trade goods, and their sale was carefully regulated.

According to Herodotus, when the Athenians learned that the Persians had landed at Marathon on the way to attack Athens in 490 BC, a messenger named Pheidippides ran to Sparta with a request for help. This original 'marathon runner' covered 260km of rugged terrain in less than two days! The Persians were subsequently defeated at the Battle of Marathon. The word marathon is the Greek word for fennel, which seems to have grown in the area and gave the battlefield its name.

He worked as a landscape watercolourist, but from the mid-1790s, he also began to paint in oils. By attempting to paint Romantic subjects of disasters in extreme weather conditions, with historical and mythological themes, his intention was to show that landscape painting could convey the emotional range of subject or history painting. 

During the 1830s, Turner's painting became increasingly bold and free. He worked in jewel-like bright colours as well as luminous pale ones, with forms dissolving in what John Constable described as 'tinted steam'.

72228529722_10154124322449723,"Happy #StGeorgesDay! This medieval pilgrim badge shows St George slaying the dragon and rescuing Lady Una. St George was probably born in the late 3rd century AD in Cappadocia, now in Turkey. He was a Christian soldier in the Roman army who refused to make a sacrifice to the Roman gods, and was executed on the orders of the Roman emperor Diocletian. He became venerated as a Christian saint and martyr and was made patron saint of England in 1222. 

Hundreds of pilgrim badges like this have been found in Britain. These personal objects vividly bring to life the faith of medieval Christians. Going on pilgrimage was an important part of Christian belief in medieval Europe and pilgrims often travelled hundreds, even thousands, of miles to visit a saint's shrine. People wore these badges attached to clothes and hats or around the neck to show where they had been on pilgrimage. This badge was probably a souvenir of a pilgrimage to Windsor. The Royal Chapel there contained relics of St George and was the centre for an important order of knights, the Order of the Garter http://ow.ly/10zvPD",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/britishmuseum/photos/a.418481824722.188981.72228529722/10154124322449723/?type=3,2016-04-23 08:00:01,1897,22,682,1824,60,13,0,0,0

This engraved portrait by Martin Droeshout is from the Third Folio of Shakespeare's works of 1663–1664 and was originally engraved for the title page to the First Folio, published in 1623. It is therefore one of the earliest portraits of Shakespeare. 

The portrait was commissioned and approved by the compilers of the First Folio, John Hemmings and Henry Condell, both members of the King's Players, Shakespeare's acting company. The involvement of these men suggest that, despite the stiff and oddly-proportioned garments, this portrait is an authentic likeness of England's most celebrated playwright. An engraving is not worked directly from life, but from a flat model, either a painting or a drawing.

As an artist he was technically superb in every medium he used – silverpoint, pen and ink, black and particularly red chalks. Driven by his scientific curiosity, he studied the world around him in minute detail, making botanical and anatomical studies. 

This work of a bust of a warrior is drawn in silverpoint, a popular medium with early Renaissance artists. The detail is extraordinary – the armour, the curls in his hair and the splendid elaborate helmet as well as the incredible modelling of the man's face and the lion on his breastplate. Metalpoint lines cannot be easily erased and requires artists to carefully plan the design or run the risk of having to start all over again. Endless patience must have been required of the young Leonardo to produce the very fine shadows of the man's face, each a separate line http://ow.ly/10ok3O",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/britishmuseum/photos/a.418481824722.188981.72228529722/10154105634559723/?type=3,2016-04-15 03:00:01,7086,80,1956,6702,314,64,5,1,0

72228529722_10154089710904723,"Long before the #GrandNational, the ancient Greeks were champion chariot racers. Chariot racing was one of the most popular spectator sports in ancient Greece and the Roman Empire. Usually, teams of four (sometimes two) horses pulled a two-wheeled chariot round a course, called a hippodrome in Greek, and a circus in Latin. The races were often extremely dangerous for both charioteer and horses – crashes, injuries and deaths were common. But chariot racing wasn't just mass entertainment – it was a way that Greek city-states and their rulers could demonstrate their power and prowess.

Greek settlements in Sicily were mostly controlled by unelected aristocratic groups and rulers called tyrannoi (tyrants). Between 490 and 468 BC, Sicilian tyrants won no fewer than 17 victories in horse racing competitions, the most famous of which were at Olympia and Delphi. Monumental sculptures of chariot groups, portrait statues and trophies were produced to celebrate these victories, and placed in sanctuaries with inscriptions praising the tyrants and honouring the gods http://ow.ly/10rVcC

The ancient Olympic Games were held every four years from 776 BC to AD 393 at Olympia in Greece. Held to honour the god Zeus, the ancient Olympics attracted thousands of citizens from all over the Greek world. Athletes competed as individuals, but a victory would also bring great honour to their home city. Over the long history of the ancient Games, huge numbers of athletes were immortalised by statues and songs written in their honour. Victors were granted the privilege of having a statue of themselves set up at Olympia, the oldest sanctuary of Zeus, which became a sort of athletic 'hall of fame'. At the first 13 Olympics the only event was the foot race. Later, more events were added including the pentathlon, combat sports and chariot racing.

Since 1896 the modern Olympic Games have also taken place every four years, but moved to a new city each time.

The owner of this object, Ahmose of Peniati, served as overseer of works to many of the kings of the early 18th Dynasty, from Amenhotep I to Thutmose III. This pot for kohl is likely to have come from his tomb. 

The pot is divided into five compartments, four of which have associated texts on the outside. One says 'fine eye paint for every day', while the other three refer to the beginning and the end of each of the three main Egyptian seasons of four months each. This suggests that different forms of the cosmetic might have been used at different times of the year.

This large bronze coin was minted at the Greek city of Cyzicus (Belkis in modern north-western Turkey) to provide small change for the local community. In common with the rest of the eastern parts of the Roman Empire this community spoke Greek. At this point of time it had developed into a form known as koine (the 'common' language). This Greco-Roman cultural mix is reflected in this coin, which looks Roman in style and displays an image of the emperor, but has Greek text. Caracalla is vividly depicted dressed in armour and carrying a spear. 

This particular example has a Christogram (a monogram of Christ) scratched just behind the bust. This could have been added at any time during the 3rd century, until this type of coin dropped out of use in the 270s.

In 1699 she travelled with her younger daughter to Surinam, a Dutch colony in South America, where she made extensive notes and sketches, and collected dried plants and animals preserved in alcohol. She returned to Amsterdam, where in 1705 she published her work on Surinamese insects, the first scientific work produced about the colony.

It was originally painted by Gu Kaizhi (about AD 345/406), considered to be the father of classical Chinese figure painting. The original painting is now lost, but is known through this close copy made over 200 years later. Throughout history, Chinese artists have sought to emulate Gu Kaizhi's 'gossamer brush line'. This scroll bears the red seals of Chinese emperors and private collectors who once owned the painting.

The scroll's full title, 'Admonitions of the Instructress to the Court Ladies', indicates the work's moralising tone. The scroll's protagonist is the court instructress who advises the ladies of the palace on correct behaviour. The poem was originally written around AD 290 to reprimand Empress Jia, who was accused of using her influence to manipulate the emperor and murder rivals, during an unstable time in Chinese history known as the Period of Disunion.

Over his lifetime, Sloane collected more than 71,000 objects which he bequeathed to George II for the nation in return for a payment of £20,000 to his heirs. The gift was accepted and on 7 June 1753, an Act of Parliament established the British Museum, the first national public museum in the world. 

Chiefly natural history specimens, Sloane's collection also included 23,000 coins and medals, 50,000 books, prints and manuscripts, a herbarium (a collection of dried plants) and 1,125 'things relating to the customs of ancient times'. 

The natural history collections were moved to a new building in South Kensington in the 1880s, which then became the Natural History Museum, London. The collection of books grew to become The British Library, which moved to St Pancras in 1997 http://ow.ly/107ssL

'an enormous stretch of flat country, a bird's eye view of it seen from the top of a hill – vineyards and fields of newly reaped wheat. All this multiplied in endless repetition, stretching away towards the horizon like the surface of a sea, bordered by the little hills of the Crau. It does not have a Japanese look, and yet it is the most Japanese thing I have done: a microscopic figure of a labourer, a little train running across the wheat field is all the animation there is in it'.

'My work crosses every department, era and culture. Projects can vary from replicating a Palaeolithic carved bone to making an intricate piece of modern jewellery. Although I usually make a 'one-off' copy of an original for a specific purpose, when a mould is made, it is always retained for future use. I've even used the moulds made by my predecessors several decades earlier! For example, in 2003 I used an old mould taken directly from the front surface of the Rosetta Stone to complete a model for visitors to touch in the Enlightenment Gallery (Room 1). Since then, I've made a further 25 copies of it which are dispersed across the globe.'

The work was devised by the court historian and mathematician Johann Stabius, who explains underneath that it was constructed after the model of 'the ancient triumphal arches of the Roman emperors'. Above the central arch, entitled 'Honour and Might', is a genealogy of Maximilian in the form of a family tree. Events from his life are represented above the left arch, 'Praise', and the right arch, 'Nobility'. These are flanked by busts of emperors and kings on the left, and a column of Maximilian's ancestors on the right. The outermost towers on either side show scenes from the private life of Maximilian.

The architect and painter Jörg Kölderer designed the overall appearance of the structure, and Albrecht Dürer designed the individual scenes and architectural elements. The date 1515, which appears on the Arch, refers to the completion of the designs. The blocks were cut by Hieronymus Andreae of Nuremberg between 1515 and 1517.

It recounts the mythical travels of the Greek prince Odysseus as he tries to return home after the Trojan War. During their travels Odysseus and his men land on an island, thought by the ancient Greeks to be Sicily. They find a cave filled with food, which they feast on. However, at dusk the cave's monstrous owner, a one-eyed giant shepherd – the Cyclops Polyphemus – returns. The Cyclops eats several of the men but Odysseus, known for his intellect, makes a plan and plies the Cyclops with wine and blinds him. This altar shows how Odysseus and his men cunningly escape from the cave, by hiding underneath Polyphemus' sheep when he lets them out to graze. Two rams amble by with men clinging to their bellies. The man on the right looks back at his unfortunate companion, whose face is pressed against the sheep's bottom.

Ancient Greeks explained the unknown through myths and legends, collected and told by poets. Sicily's fertile landscape and wild coastline inspired many of these stories. Find out more about the ancient Greeks who settled on Sicily in our #SicilyExhibition, opening 21 April http://ow.ly/ZK6Qu

In the first part of the poem, the king warns his son not to trust anyone, and he describes how he was killed by his own bodyguard. He moves from the dangers that face kingship to describe his own achievements and ends by acclaiming the accession of his son Senwosret. 

The poem became a classic and many copies survive from the New Kingdom (1550–1070 BC). Copies that survive from the 4th century BC indicate that the text was still being read hundreds of years later. The interest that the text held for the original ancient Egyptian audience probably had much to do with the central nature of kingship and the dramatic nature of the poetry.

They belonged to an Armenian woman whose family migrated to Syria in the early 20th century, and had been part of her grandmother's wedding dowry. 

Before the exhibition the clogs were examined to check their condition – the metal was tarnished and the textile dirty and peeling off in places. As such, they were treated by two conservators, one specialising in the treatment of metals, the other organic materials. Interestingly this work is often a combination of art, culture and science – the conservators and curator have to decide what to do, but also what to leave. The idea with these clogs was to clean, but not overclean, and stick down the lifting velvet in the right position as shown by the folds and wear in the textile. The marks where the clogs have been worn tell their own stories...

These tokens give a fascinating insight into the workings of trade and business during this time, but also city life in general. Spreading only as far as the knowledge of the shop or business extended, they contain information which is very local in nature – the name of the issuer, the business they were involved in, their address and the token's value. The sheer size of London, as compared to other urban centres, meant that there were more tokens issued in Drury Lane than in the whole of the city of Gloucester.

This copper coffee house token was issued by Timothy Child at some point between 1649 and 1672 and was to be used as tender in 'YE COFFE HOUSE IN RUSSELL STREET' – very near to where the British Museum is today! Coffee shops sprang up throughout London following the arrival of the first in St Michael's Alley, Cornhill in 1652 and became popular venues for people to discuss the news of the day http://ow.ly/Yrhzs

72228529722_10154009055549723,"This statue depicting a warrior was made in the 5th century BC, and was found at the site of the ancient Greek colony of Akragas (Agrigento) on Sicily's southern coast. It would have originally been part of a larger group of figures, whether high on a temple or at eye level. Combat figures reminded the Greeks of their legendary past and of the ever-present threat of war. There are no natural reserves of marble on Sicily, so the marble used in this statue would have been imported from another part of the Mediterranean.

The statue has recently undergone conservation work at the Museo Archeologico Regionale Pietro Griffo in Agrigento, in preparation for our #SicilyExhibition. Conservators examined the overall structure of the sculpture and its marble surface, and the process led to some exciting new discoveries. They cleaned the surface of the sculpture with a laser and applied pads made of rice paper to treat areas of discolouration caused by iron oxidation. This helped to balance the different tones of the three marble fragments that make up the sculpture. Through the cleaning process they discovered that the warrior's helmet featured remnants of a painted palmette (fan-shaped) design. Ancient Greek sculptures such as this would have originally been painted, often in vibrant colours, but the paint rarely survives. #BSW16

When the goblet was assessed, the conservator found that the adhesive used to previously repair the object had weakened. This meant that the whole vessel needed to be dismantled and reconstructed. Museum scientists chemically analysed the glass of the goblet to highlight its ingredients, using the technique of scanning electron microscopy. This research confirmed that the goblet's production was consistent with methods used in Venice in the late 15th century.

These ingots and metal rings date from the 14th century BC and were found at el-Amarna in Egypt. They give us rare archaeological evidence for Egypt's earliest money system. Before coins started to circulate in ancient Egypt around 500 BC, there was a system of values based on weights of gold, silver and copper. Metal measured in units of weight known as deben (around 90g) could be used to settle bills and to trade. Egypt had no easily accessible source of silver, but the Egyptian word for silver, hedj, came to mean something close to 'money'. The complete ingots from el-Amarna weigh around 3 deben (265–286g) and the rings seem to be fractions of the deben http://ow.ly/Yrguu #MoneyFact

The British Museum is responsible for administering the Treasure Act 1996. As part of this process, every Wednesday morning, the Museum's metals conservators work on newly found Treasure objects. Conservators examine each find, investigating its context as well as carrying out chemical and physical treatments to reveal enough detail for identification. Where coins are found it is necessary to determine, as far as possible, the legend stamped on each side so that experts are able to identify each one. This conservation treatment means that it's possible to identify many coins and gain valuable insights into the objects that would otherwise be lost.

Throughout history currency has taken many different forms. The worth of a material can be based on a number of factors, including its availability, versatility or simply its aesthetic qualities.

This feather money is used as a form of currency in the Melanesian island group of Santa Cruz (south-east of the Solomon Islands and north of Vanuatu). This currency, known as 'tevau', is formed as coils resembling long belts. It is used to make payments to a bride's family, for purchasing pigs and large canoes. The supply is limited by the availability of these feathers and the man-hours involved in its manufacture. The production of the feather coils is limited to just a few hereditary specialists, working on one island, who are thought to receive their skills from spirits. The value of a coil is dependent on its condition – newly made, vividly coloured examples are most valuable http://ow.ly/Yroyd

Extensive studies undertaken by the Museum's scientists have now revealed striking new insights about how they were made and from which raw materials. The research shows that skilled woodworkers, lapidaries and mosaic-setters drew on a great array of materials gathered through the far-reaching trading and tribute networks of the Aztec empire, which at its height encompassed much of Central America. The combination of colours, materials and iconography in the mosaics was intrinsic to their high status and the purposes for which they were made – they were probably worn or used by priests and rulers for religious rituals and ceremonies.

In the late 4th century AD, Roman taxes were only payable in gold. It was by far the most valuable material available and was the most stable in value of all monetary materials. To ensure the continued purity of the gold coinage, in about AD 367 the emperors ordered that all gold coins paid in tax were to be melted down into bars before being turned back into coin. There were many forgeries and it was easier for the government to test a smaller number of large bars than millions of individual coins. Roman gold coins contained about 98% pure gold. These gold bars represent the intermediate form which the gold took after melting and before it was turned back into coins. http://ow.ly/Yrm5r

72228529722_10154001354799723,"Beware the Ides of March! Julius Caesar was assassinated #onthisday in 44 BC. According to the ancient historian Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. This was later famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when a soothsayer warns Caesar to 'beware the Ides of March.'

This coin was struck in honour of Marcus Junius Brutus, one of the assassins of Julius Caesar. The back of the coin shows the cap of liberty given to freed slaves flanked by two daggers. This indicates Brutus' intention of freeing Rome from Caesar's imperial ambitions and the murder weapons employed to do so. Below the cap is the day of the deed – EID.MAR, the Ides of March.

Few coins capture a moment in history with such stark and brutal imagery. Brutus had carried out the attack with some fellow Roman Senators in 44 BC when Caesar had come unarmed to address the Senate on 15 March. This day was known to the Romans as the ides, or the middle day of the month and was recognised on a new calendar system that Caesar himself had established just two years before.

The assassins, or 'freedom party' as they regarded themselves, fled Rome to Macedonia to raise an army. However, they were defeated by Caesar's allies led by Mark Antony and Octavian at the Battle of Philippi (42 BC). Brutus subsequently committed suicide http://ow.ly/ZiIT0",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/britishmuseum/photos/a.418481824722.188981.72228529722/10154001354799723/?type=3,2016-03-15 04:12:29,5279,98,1979,5136,66,60,1,16,0

Egyptian blue is a pigment that was used in ancient Egypt for thousands of years, often associated with depictions of divinity. It has many interesting scientific properties, one of which is that it exhibits visible-induced infrared luminescence (VIL) – this means it emits infrared light when illuminated with visible light. Because of this, we can detect whether the pigment is present using a camera sensitive to infrared. British Museum scientists have used this method to reveal hidden secrets in wall painting fragments from the tomb of Nebamun, dating from 1350 BC.

During the English Civil War besieged towns were sometimes required to issue 'money of necessity'. This may have been to reassure mercenaries, or also simply to allow for everyday transactions. In 1645–1646, three royalist fortresses under siege produced coinage. When Carlisle was surrounded by a Scottish army, an order was published to every citizen to bring in their silverware. Overall, 1,162 ounces of silver was gathered on that occasion. During the year-long siege of Scarborough Castle, the commander, Sir Hugh Chomley, handed out the siege money himself to encourage the morale of those who were repairing the walls. The Newark coinage produced during its third siege is of a very good quality and includes weights of the correct official standards. Here are examples of money produced during these three sieges http://ow.ly/YqRaa

The informal, intimate nature of Peruzzi's portrayal of three figures is not typical of his work. Peruzzi was born in Siena but worked in Rome as a painter and architect and it is possible that this work dates from the period when he was working alongside the Venetian painter Sebastiano del Piombo in around 1511.

Britannia, the personification of Britain, first appeared on coins of the emperor Hadrian (r. AD 117–138), the builder of the great wall across Britain. However, Antoninus Pius (r. AD 138–161) also built a wall, across lowland Scotland between the rivers Forth and Clyde, known as the Antonine Wall. 

This coin, dated to AD 155, was common in Britain but rare in other parts of the Roman Empire. It may well have formed part of a special shipment of coin to the island. The image on this coin has long fascinated scholars. Some argue that the figure of Britannia is in mourning because she holds her hand to her forehead. The traditional explanation of this is that a British revolt had recently been put down by the Roman army. It could also be argued that the coin shows Britannia in a state of relaxed peace, perhaps in the act of drawing up the hood of her cloak.

The eyes on this mask appear closed, which is common with many Quimbaya figures in gold.

It was located 77km south of the harbour city of Thonis-Heracleion, up the Canopic branch of the Nile. Naukratis was both a royal Egyptian port and a Greek port of trade. The site was discovered in 1884 by Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie, a pioneer of Egyptian archaeology. Since 2012 the British Museum has conducted new fieldwork at this important site. This has revealed the whole extent of the city – at least 600,000m2 in size with over 16,000 inhabitants. New excavation at the Hellenion, the largest Greek sanctuary in Egypt, has uncovered new evidence for religious practices, as well as material culture suggesting a high degree of cultural mixing between Greeks and Egyptians – but also Cypriots and Phoenicians.

Underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio and his team discovered the temple's impressive remains, as well as the head of its cult statue – which was originally more than 4 metres high. The head was found in a statue dump along with other stunning pieces of Greco-Egyptian art such as the elegant statue of queen Arsinoe II.

The millionth object recently recorded by PAS was a Roman coin in a hoard of 22,000 others dating to around AD 341. The copper-alloy coin, called a nummus, was struck in AD 332 at the mint of Lugdunum in Gaul (modern Lyon in France) and found in Seaton, Devon, near the previously excavated site of a Roman villa. The coin shows the personification of Constantinopolis on the obverse and a Victory on prow on the reverse. This very common type was struck by Constantine the Great across the Roman Empire to celebrate the inauguration of the new city of Constantinople, which was to become the capital of the Eastern Empire.

Located on the Mediterranean coast at the mouth of the Canopic branch of the Nile, the city guarded the western entrance to Egypt and controlled its maritime trade. The whole site consists of several islands, with a network of channels and port basins connecting the inland areas with the Mediterranean Sea and the Nile. Thonis-Heracleion was also a major religious centre – the two most important temples discovered so far are dedicated to Amun, king of the Egyptian gods, and his son Khonsu-the-Child (who was identified with the Greek Herakles).

Constantine had a huge influence on the development of Europe in the Middle Ages. Under his rule, Christianity was no longer persecuted, and his reforms led to it becoming the official religion of the Roman Empire (in AD 380). He also re-founded the city of Constantinople (named after himself) and made it the Empire's new capital.

Another important legacy of Constantine's authority is his coinage. This silver argenteus comes from the very beginning of Constantine's reign, when he was still Caesar (junior emperor). The design on the other side of the coin shows the gate of a Roman military camp. This design was copied on coins of the Anglo-Saxon king Edward the Elder (r.

Renoir's paintings were always light-hearted, with soft-feathered brushstrokes capturing fleeting movement and mottled light. His later works concentrate on the female nude and he tended to emphasise simple forms and solidity, as well as relishing pink and orange flesh, as this study illustrates.

Discovered in 2010, this hoard of 52,503 coins is the largest from Roman Britain found in a single container. This hoard is also significant as aspects of its burial suggest that it might not have been intended to be recovered. This challenges the conventional view that hoards were buried in emergency situations in the unstable 3rd century AD. It was found on high ground, near a spring, in a place that was used again for the burial of another hoard of coins around a century later, clearly a place with some longer term importance. The total hoard, weighing 160kg, was so heavy it could not have been lifted out of the ground without breaking the fragile pot.

Together with an aryballos (oil-flask) and a sponge, they probably formed a portable set for the athlete to take to sport sessions. Before exercising or competing, athletes applied oil to their bodies to keep the dirt out of the pores of the skin and perhaps also to avoid sunburn. Afterwards a strigil was used to scrape off the accumulated oil, dirt, and sand from the sports ground. Strigils are often of different sizes and shapes to suit different parts of the body. This set of strigils is decorated with scenes from the Roman circus, where chariot races took place that attracted huge crowds. This prestigious set must have belonged to a successful or at least a wealthy sportsman, with a keen interest in chariot racing or perhaps himself a winning charioteer http://ow.ly/XDuXO",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/britishmuseum/photos/a.418481824722.188981.72228529722/10153910083754723/?type=3,2016-02-09 08:47:16,297,5,40,297,0,0,0,0,0

This head from an oversized marble statue depicts her as Ceres, the goddess of cereals. The cult of Livia as Ceres, a mother whose fertility benefited the whole empire, became widespread, indicating the vital role that grain played in control of the empire. It was particularly embraced on Sicily, where Ceres' Greek equivalent, Demeter, had been worshipped for centuries. Sicily – dubbed 'Rome's granary' – was important as it provided an abundant supply of grain, which was used to feed the ever-growing populace back in Rome. http://ow.ly/XFKjK

They seem to have been used as a means of making official payments, such as taxes or judicial fines. Their value was used as a unit to assess a citizen's wealth. The ingots were no longer made after the mid-3rd century BC, when the Romans moved over entirely to silver coins, but bronze remained important within the Roman monetary system. 

The elephant design on this example was probably inspired by the war elephants in the army of the Greek king Pyrrhus who invaded Italy and attacked the Romans in 280 BC. The pig on the other side may refer to a bizarre occasion when, in one of the battles, Pyrrhus' elephants were frightened away by the grunting of pigs kept by the Roman army! http://ow.ly/XGxcI

As a result of Napoleon's defeat in 1815, Ingres was cut off from potential patrons, and he turned again to portraiture to support himself. 

Although he disliked the drudgery of such commissioned work, Ingres drew many beautiful and intimate pencil portraits of his friends, and this style of portrait became popular with paying customers. In 1816, Ingres was commissioned by George Forbes, a Scottish tourist, to draw him with his fiancé Mary Hay. Ingres developed a composition appropriate to a betrothal, but Forbes was called away from Rome before the drawing could be completed. Mary's brother, Sir John Hay, stood in for Forbes, but Ingres refused to alter the composition.

Parmigianino's real name was Francesco Mazzola, but was known as the 'little Parmesan' as he came from the north Italian city of Parma. Before moving to Rome in 1524, the young Parmigianino had received important public commissions in his native Parma. Once in Rome he collaborated with specialists such as Ugo da Carpi to produce engravings and woodcuts that captured the movement and drama of his figure drawings. 

After moving to Bologna in 1527, he experimented with the new technique of etching to find a style that reproduced the personal refinement of his drawings. This etching, titled 'The Entombment', represents his greatest success. The graceful movements of the women turning towards or away from the light, and the virtuoso draughtsmanship of the artist, give the work a self-conscious style, which was much admired in the Italian courts http://ow.ly/W1DP3",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/britishmuseum/photos/a.418481824722.188981.72228529722/10153844104109723/?type=3,2016-01-11 05:04:59,2236,23,358,2236,0,0,0,0,0

The historian Suetonius reported that Caesar uttered the famous phrase 'alea iacta est' meaning 'the die is cast' – the idiom 'crossing the Rubicon' now means to pass a point of no return.

It is made from the wreckage of a boat carrying refugees from Eritrea and Somalia that sank off the coast of the Italian island Lampedusa in 2013. 500 people were on board when the overcrowded boat caught fire, capsized and sank. Only 151 people survived. The cross was made by Mr Francesco Tuccio, a carpenter who lives and works on the island. Mr Tuccio met some of the survivors in his church of San Gerlando and, frustrated by his inability to make any difference to their plight, he went and collected some of the timber from the wreckage and made each of them a cross to reflect their salvation and as a symbol of hope for the future http://ow.ly/W45RB

The period preceding the coronation of Henri IV was one of great turbulence, with the wars of religion dividing French Catholics and Protestants, leading to infamous events of violence. Henri's accession as king was not unifying – he was a Protestant, on the side of the Huguenots. Crowned King of Navarre in 1572, he married Margaret of Valois in an attempt at unity but he became a prisoner at court. After the assassination of Henri III in 1589, he became King of France. Opposition from the nobility forced Henri to convert to Catholicism in 1593. 

Henri's second marriage to Marie de Medici in 1600 and the birth of an heir (later Louis XIII) in 1601 helped to quell uncertainty. Henri commissioned versions of this medal in silver and gold in 1602–1603 to celebrate the birth of the Dauphin Louis.

This romantic Victorian reimagining of a scene described by Roman author Pliny the Elder was intended to evoke an authentic Scottish past.

Renoir's paintings were always light-hearted, with soft-feathered brushstrokes capturing fleeting movement and mottled light. His later works concentrate on the female nude and he tended to emphasise simple forms and solidity, as well as relishing pink and orange flesh, as this study illustrates.

72228529722_10153756365299723,"Artist Otto Dix was born #onthisday in 1891. Dix had been strongly affected by his experience as a soldier in the German army in the First World War and his work would be haunted by the brutality that he witnessed. He was also particularly interested in the metalpoint technique, executing more than 200 silverpoint drawings between 1931 and 1944. The medium was a perfect match for his desire to see things frankly and honestly and to achieve the detail and precise form he observed in the art of the Old Masters. In this portrait titled Old Woman, he tenderly portrays the ageing character of his model. Each line is crisp and distinct as he closely studied her wrinkled, furrowed, and sagging skin, and the sheen and texture of her hair.

The Etruscans lived in what is now Italy before the rise of the Romans, flourishing between the 8th and 1st centuries BC. Feasts, with music and entertainment, were important in Etruscan life, and scenes of banqueting are common. This bronze figurine may have been placed as a dedication in a shrine or sanctuary. Feasts depicted on the walls of tombs may represent funerary feasts or feasting in the afterlife, though other representations seem to be everyday social occasions. The bronze banqueter reclines on a couch, in a way that was typical in the Classical world. He has an impressive and carefully delineated beard and moustache, and is dressed in a decorated chiton or tunic. The bowl that he holds is of the type used both at banquets and for libations – the offering of small quantities of liquids, such as wine, to the gods http://ow.ly/UQvd0

These tiny bronze dolphins were used as money in Greek cities around the Black Sea, which began to be established as colonies from the 8th century BC onwards. There was also a strong native non-Greek population in the area, which flourished alongside the colonists. This mixture of cultures resulted in a curious variety of monetary forms. Around the city of Olbia on the north coast of the Black Sea large numbers of tiny, cast bronze dolphins have been discovered. They are sometimes found in groups, and in several instances have been discovered in tombs in the hands or mouths of the dead.

The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, giving an account of the life and sayings of Jesus, were accepted. Others such as the so-called Gospel of Mary were not.

The early medieval monasteries of Britain and Ireland were flourishing centres of faith, art and learning.

The decoration on objects like this was an important way for them to communicate Christian teachings, as few people in early medieval Ireland could read or write. Some of the tinned and gilded panels illustrate biblical stories, such as Daniel in the lions' den.

It must have been brought from the Mediterranean and the metalworker who made the flagons drew on an impressive range of influences. The forms were inspired by Etruscan flagons from northern Italy, while the stylised dogs on the handles resemble central Asian art. Dogs hunting a duck may represent a scene from a local myth.

72228529722_10153718353924723,"Edward III of England was born #onthisday in 1312. Gold coinage was revived during his reign to help with international trade. This new coin consisted of a florin, or double leopard, of fine gold, exactly double the size of the Florentine florin, to be worth six shillings. Although the new coinage's standards were based on the florin, its designs followed French influence. The king is shown seated, holding orb and sceptre, with two heraldic English leopards beside him, and a Gothic canopy overhead, with a background of fleurs-de-lis. These, and the title 'king of France' included in the inscription, reflect Edward's claims to the French throne which underpinned the beginnings of the Hundred Years War (1339–1453).

The new coinage was not a success: its face value was higher than the value of the gold. Also, a coin worth six shillings did not fit well into the English monetary system, with 20 shillings in the pound, or 13s 4d in the mark. It was soon replaced by the noble, a coin worth 6s 8d which, being worth a third of a pound, and half a mark, was much more useful.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/britishmuseum/photos/a.418481824722.188981.72228529722/10153718353924723/?type=3,2015-11-13 03:00:01,1395,10,273,1395,0,0,0,0,0

This broadsheet – published in 1617, on the centenary of the Reformation – depicts the early Reformation of the Christian Church as a prophetic dream of Friedrich III, a political protector of Martin Luther.

Luther is shown writing on a church door with an enormously long pen, referencing the moment he publicly posted his 95 Theses in the town of Wittenberg. The pen stretches across half of the picture to emphasise the importance of the written word to Protestants, as opposed to images which were popular in the Catholicism of the time. The end of the pen passes through the ears of a lion and knocks off the tiara, or crown, of the pope of the time, Leo X, hence the lion.

72228529722_10153694634079723,"Cowrie shells have been used as money in many parts of the world, including China, Africa and Arabia. In China, inscriptions which talk of 'gifts of cowries', 'cowries in the treasury', 'seizure of cowries', 'use of cowries' and 'rewards of cowries' are found on bones and on bronze vessels of the Shang (16th–11th centuries BC) and Zhou (11th century–221 BC) dynasties.
Archaeologists have found that the distribution of cowrie finds coincides with the gradual acquisition of territories by the Zhou dynasty and noble lords. The natural supply of cowrie shells from the coastal regions could not meet the growing demand inland. People began to make imitation cowries out of bone, horn, shell, stone, clay, lead, bronze, gold and silver http://ow.ly/THb6q

He then describes measures of relief he brought to the inhabitants of the city, and tells how he returned a number of images of gods, which Nabonidus had collected in Babylon, to their proper temples throughout Mesopotamia and western Iran. At the same time he arranged for the restoration of these temples, and organised the return to their homelands of a number of people who had been held in Babylonia by the Babylonian kings.

At the beginning of the Ming dynasty the imperial court was located in Nanjing, but between 1403 and 1445 it was gradually moved to Beijing. The Yongle emperor commissioned the building of a new palace in 1417, modelling it on the Nanjing palace. It was built on the site of the abandoned Mongol Yuan dynasty palace. Beijing was established as the capital with the palace – now known as the Forbidden City – at its heart, and through a network of regional courts, the Ming emperors controlled a country the size of Europe. 

This hanging scroll shows the Forbidden City swathed in clouds, giving a sense of the vast size of the palace complex which covered over 720,000 square metres. The perspective allows us to see right up to the emperor's private quarters at the back.

From the beginning he planned a dome over his new building, making it England's only cathedral built in the classical architectural tradition. He altered the shape and profile of the dome several times but it was not until around 1697 that the exact design for the dome was agreed and it was finally completed in 1710. This freehand drawing by Wren was made to show the relation of the inner and outer domes.

We can only speculate as to why the cross was added – did it neutralise spirits thought to dwell in images, or was it added to 'Christianise' a popular member of the imperial family?

The British Museum opened its doors to visitors for the first time on 15 January 1759. The Trustees decided that the Museum should be freely open to the general public as well as to academic visitors. However, they were afraid that the collections would be damaged if large crowds of people were allowed into the building. They therefore ordered that visitors should not be admitted unless they held tickets, and that only a small number of tickets should be issued for each day.

Like this ticket, issued for 1 p.m., all tickets were issued for a particular time. Visitors were taken around the Museum in groups of five, each group guided by one of the Under-Librarians. They were taken up the Great Staircase, through the upper rooms and down again to the ground floor. During their tour they were shown the collections of manuscripts, medals, antiquities and natural history.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/britishmuseum/photos/a.418481824722.188981.72228529722/10153613924219723/?type=3,2015-09-17 11:49:14,6121,98,1366,6121,0,0,0,0,0

This double-edged sword was found in the River Witham near Lincoln. It is an extremely well preserved example of the type of sword which was common from about 1300. The blade is made of steel, which combines a sharply honed edge with the flexibility not to shatter in use, and is inlaid with gold wire to form an inscription which is yet to be deciphered.

Spearthrowers like these are the Swiss army knife of the desert. Created and used exclusively by men, the broad body of these spearthrowers hints at its other functions. Its firm edges were used for digging in the desert sand and scraping the ground in preparing a place to sleep. Those same hardwood edges were sawed furiously against softer wood, to create the smouldering embers by which desert people made fire. In some parts of Australia stone knives were hafted to its end with natural resins, allowing the spearthrower to also be used for butchering animals and as a chisel for engraving other objects http://ow.ly/PgNg3",Photos from British Museum's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/britishmuseum/photos/a.418481824722.188981.72228529722/10153431028969723/?type=3,2015-07-07 04:39:36,706,4,77,706,0,0,0,0,0

This exhibition will feature around 100 of the best examples of #metalpoint spanning six centuries. Metalpoint is a challenging drawing technique where a metal stylus is used on a roughened preparation, ensuring that a trace of the metal is left on the surface. When mastered it can produce drawings of crystalline clarity and refinement. 

This exhibition was organised by the National Gallery of Art, Washington in association with the British Museum.

72228529722_10152765861784723,"The Sydney Opera House opened #onthisday in 1973.

Designed by the Danish architect Jørn Utzon, the Sydney Opera House provoked fierce public controversy in the 1960s as much over the escalating cost of its construction as the innovative brilliance of its domed sail-like halls. Now recognised the world over as a magnificent architectural icon jutting into Sydney Harbour, the Sydney Opera House finally opened in 1973. 

In this Christmas card for 1972 Eric Thake (1904–1982) cheekily anticipates the long awaited opening with his domestic version of the grand architectural statement. Crockery stacked in a drying rack forms the shape of the Sydney Opera House, with water from the kitchen sink adjacent. The small housefly resting on one of the stacked plates adds an unmistakably Australian touch. http://ow.ly/D1sbs

We state that the Buddha was born into a small kingdom that flourished in north-eastern India in about 500 BC. The kingdom covered a reasonably wide area in the northern plains, along with several others of the time. When the Buddha's mother was expecting, the family decided that she should proceed north to the hills to give birth. This she did, but gave birth along the way, in Lumbini at foot of the Himalayas. The site of Lumbini is in Nepal about 20 miles from the modern border with the Republic of India.
